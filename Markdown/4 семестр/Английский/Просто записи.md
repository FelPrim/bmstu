Текст для презентации по английскому:
We know, some modern physics' frameworks are generalizations of theories of the past - for example, classical mechanics is just a special case of the equations of the theory of relativity at speeds negligibly small compared to the speed of light.

As we know, Fermat's principle (also known as principle of least time) states that path taken by a rey between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time.

According to modern physics light silmultaneously exhibits properties of particles and waves. This phenomena is named "Wave-particle duality". So, my short presentation is simplified derivation of Fermat's principle from modern axioms. 
Imagine two points: point 1 and point 2. It is known that photon moved from first point two the second. Light is a wave, so its' state depends on time and position in space. 
$f(\varphi_{0}+\omega t+k\vec{r})$
Let's look at 2 paths from 1 to 2: A and B. Light's phase at the point 2 varies, because light will take different time to reach that point. The amplitude of sum of this waves depends on their phases in that point.
$\varphi=\varphi_{0}+\omega t+kx$
then
$d\varphi= kdx-\omega dt$
$d\varphi=(kv-\omega)dt$
$\varphi=\int_{T_{0}}^{T_{1}} (kv-\omega)dt$
From that equation we get that
$\varphi=\frac{1}{h} \int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} dS$, where S - is an action. 
If S is minimal than $dS=0$ (it is a nessessary condition for extremum of the function).

**Fermat's principle**, also known as the **principle of least time**, is the link between [ray optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics "Geometrical optics") and [wave optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_optics "Physical optics"). Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a [ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_\(optics\) "Ray (optics)") between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time.


As we know, Snell's law (also known as law of refraction) states which states that, for a given pair of media, the ratio of sines of angle of incidence and angle of refraction is equal to the refractive index of the second medium with regard to the first

**Snell's law** (also known as the **Snell–Descartes law**, the **ibn-Sahl** **law**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law#cite_note-1) and the **law of refraction**) is a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula "Formula") used to describe the relationship between the [angles of incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_\(optics\) "Angle of incidence (optics)") and [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction"), when referring to [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") or other [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") passing through a boundary between two different [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic") [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_\(optics\) "Medium (optics)"), such as water, glass, or air. In optics, the law is used in [ray tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_\(physics\) "Ray tracing (physics)") to compute the angles of incidence or refraction, and in experimental optics to find the [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index") of a material. The law is also satisfied in [meta-materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterials#Negative_refractive_index "Metamaterials"), which allow light to be bent "backward" at a negative angle of refraction with a [negative refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index#Negative_refractive_index "Refractive index").

Electromagnetism as a purely geometric theory
1 Introduction
The history of physics may be viewed as a slow progression from particle-oriented concepts towards
wave-oriented concepts. A thousand years ago, a discussion of “fields” and “waves” would have been
met with blank stares. Only the concept of matter particles existed at the time, with direct mechanical
interactions among them. Waves were only observed on the surface of water, and were neither understood
mathematically nor were they thought to be related to anything else. Scientists of the middle ages thought
of light as a stream of small “light balls”. Later, in particular, Isaac Newton (1642-1726) advocated the
particle view of light, whereas Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) advocated the wave-picture of light.
Earlier, the philosopher and inventor of analytic geometry, Ren´e Descartes (1596-1650) had advocated
a wave theory of light as well. During the 19th century, the flying “light balls” model was replaced by
a “waves of aether balls” model, which in turn was replaced in the 1920s by the “waves of electric and
magnetic fields” model. By now, all mechanical and chemical forces are also described as being exerted
by such electromagnetic waves. Approximately one hundred years ago, the notion that elementary matter
particles might also be quantum mechanical waves started to gain acceptance. In this sense, our work
fits into the historic trend, and represents a next step in the understanding of wave-oriented concepts.
A key milestone in the development of wave oriented concepts was the recognition during the early
20th century that gravity is essentially not a force, but a manifestation of spacetime curvature, due to
Albert Einstein in 1915. As the Earth orbits the Sun, it moves along a straight trajectory of its local
spacetime metric. The curvature of spacetime metric around the Sun is the origin of the circular Earth
orbit; with the proper accounting of this spacetime curvature there is no further need to apply any
additional gravitational force. It is a logical next question to ask whether electromagnetic forces can
be also accounted for by spacetime curvature. The present work focuses on this question, and we find
that the geometric accounting of electromagnetic fields and charges are inseparable. In other words, the
proper accounting of spacetime curvature yields not only electromagnetic forces, but also charges. Thismeans, that currents and charges are not external sources, but they can be endogenized to be immanent
properties of the spacetime metric, along with the electromagnetic field.
In [1], it was shown that the (singular) metric composed of the tensor product of the electromagnetic
four-potential with itself yields Maxwell’s equations, if we demand Ricci-flatness from the metric. On
the other hand, in the paper [2], the Stueckelberg wave equation, see [3], and the Schr¨odinger equation
were derived from a stochastic optimal control scheme on a Minkowskian spacetime, when it was assumed
that the test particle is affected by Brownian noise on the spacetime manifold. Furthermore, in [4] the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle was deduced from such spacetime optimal control approach. In [2], the
Stueckelberg and Schr¨odinger equations can be derived as the linearized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations,
assuming that the value function is locally smooth and thus linear. Local linear approximation is
indeed appropriate on Planck scales.
The above-mentioned results could indicate, that quantum mechanics is an instrumental theory in the
sense that it describes correctly the universe at small scales. Nevertheless, it could be that for example
random movements of electrons could result from something more fundamental described in relativistic
electrodynamics. For example, a stochastic metric could lead to stochastic forces, which may be
phenomenologically modeled using the spacetime diffusion approach. The quantum mechanical model
presented in [2] starts from an assumption that there is a potential defined on the Minkowski spacetime
and the test particle undergoes Brownian motion with a controlled drift. Minimizing the expected
canonical action then leads to the equations of quantum mechanics when we assume a locally linear value
function. The model thus assumes exogenous noise structure for the test particle. The dual approach is
that we assume that the spacetime itself is fluctuating at Planck scales [5, 6, 7].
If electrodynamic force, i.e. the Lorentz force could be related directly to metrics, it directly leads
to the explanation of the Zitterbewegung phenomenon and quantum mechanical waves as well. This
result shall be derived in sections 5 and 6.
For the above assumptions to work, we would need to be able to establish electrodynamics as a purely
geometrical theory. In other words, the electromagnetic field should be derived purely and solely from
the properties of the metric tensor. As for the Lorentz force, the force on charges should be derived as
some geometrical property as well. It turns out that these requirements can be fulfilled. Electromagnetic
field obeys a requirement, where in general nature wants to minimize the deviation of Weyl geometry
from pseudo-Riemannian geometry. On the other hand, the Lorentz force law is the geodesic equation in
disguise.
The covariant divergence of the electromagnetic four-potential was assumed to be related to the charge
density in [1]. The presence of an electric charge however would then violate the condition of metric
compatibility of the metric and thus we must have a more general connection. The property of torsionlessness
can be retained, but metric compatibility must be replaced with a weaker assumption of
semimetricity. This gives us exactly the Weyl geometry discussed for example in [8]. Hermann Weyl
(1885-1955) introduced this geometry in 1918, when he was trying to combine gravity with electromagnetism
[9]. According to Erhard Scholz, in [10] he says ”Weyl’s original scale geometry of 1918 (“purely
infinitesimal geometry”) was withdrawn by its author from physical theorizing in the early 1920s. It
made a surprising comeback, however, in the last third of the 20th century in several different contexts:
scalar-tensor theories of gravity, foundations of spacetime theories, foundations of quantum mechanics,
elementary particle physics, and cosmology. It seems that Weyl geometry continues to offer an open
window for research on the foundations of physics even after the turn into the new millennium.”. The
present approach gives a different identification for the 1-form as compared to the original Weyl’s approach.
Weyl geometry and its possible conformity with existing physics is discussed for example in [11].
It has been the tradition in general relativity that the spacetime is modeled using pseudo-Riemannian geometry.
In particular, this assumption implies that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor vanishes
everywhere. However, there are extensions to the pseudo-Riemannian geometry where this fundamental
assumption is omitted. We consider Weyl geometry, where the covariant derivative ∇σ of the metric
tensor gμν is of a special form
